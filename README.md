# notation

This is my final project for Mobile Music taught by Dr. Allison @ LSU

## technical aspects

The prototype is a 2.5D platformer.  2D movement, 3D world
It is designed to be used with a controller
Left and right on the left-thumbstick controls horizontal movement
The A button allows for a jump
The right trigger places a note
for the default sword, a note is placed approx 2/3rds along the length away from the player
for the bow, a block is fired from the bow and when it collides with the world geometry, it places a note there
Switching from the sword & bow is done via pressing up on the d-pad
Left trigger will start playing the composition from Y=0, to Y=-infinity, as a debug option
note pitch is determined with the Z-position of the note

## reason for making the project
I am unaware of a game that allows one to compose as they are playing.
This combined with the final project's purpose of combining music and mobility led me down this path
of creating a flow of music, moving an avatar to produce a composition.
